Hosts file downloader and merger

This program was created for automagically download and update the hosts file to remove ads from anywhere.

It works in both Linux, Windows (Make sure to edit the preferences file to include the correct path) and Mac, (Not tested. The same as windows).

I suggest to add this to a cron job.
